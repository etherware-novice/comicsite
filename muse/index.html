<h3>write a myth that's relevant to your life. it can be in a more traditional form, take on a modern tone-- be a retelling or an entirely new piece. have fun with it! what makes a myth?</h3>

<p>
Long before the age of man, animals ruled the lands. Each knew their place in the world, and everyone was happy. Except one. Single. Fox. This fox, for reasons unknown, this fox admired the myriad of other, more talented, animals around them. They tried to join them, poorly mimicking the things the others did, but this only resulted in them and everyone around them being hurt. One person simply cannot do everything, but the stupid fox couldn't get that into their mind and kept trying fruitlessly for eternity.
