The woods was a peaceful place, with bunnies hopping to and fro wherever you gazed. One pitiful creature, the wolf, couldn't stand seeing everyone else happy. They needed to satiate their loneliness, and trotted into the woods. All the other bunnies eyed them wearily, but slowly integrated the wolf into their group. Now, the wolf never meant any harm, they had truly just wanted a friend, but the nature of a wolf is to ruin everything. After being forced out with their tail between their legs, the wolf left to search for another group to maybe not ruin this time..
