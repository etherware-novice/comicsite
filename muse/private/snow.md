it came one night without warning  
the snow  
it clung to the roofs, the road, anything unprotected  
its influence seeping in  
damaging everything  
ruining the grass and trees  
it melted just as fast, the next day  
it only existed in shadows  
the road was cleared, the flowers resprouted  
and everything appeared normal  
but the aftertaste  
the distant frost  
never goes away
