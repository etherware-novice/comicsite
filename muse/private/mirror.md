whats that in the mirror?  
blobs of black  
whats that?  
soul of black  
why?  
the road to hell is paved with good intentions  
take the high road  
the spikes aer painful  
its either you or them that gets hurt  
seems unfair to me  
YOU OR THEM  
just think better  
just get better brain  
shut it all off  
stop bouncing between miserable attempts to socialize  
stop destroying us both  
emotionally  
stop wanting for others goals  
pick your own  
i cant  
be patient  
the pain  
of what  
the loneliness  
simply shut up  
stop it  
please  
youre destroying us both
