the planet of quicksand  
it looks inviting  
just a simple desert planet, what could go wrong?  
it even masquerades as livable for a few weeks  
enjoyable, even  
hit it in just the wrong spot, and it becomes a black hole  
timewaster  
for hours  
once is excusable, but the frequency of it  
everyone who makes contact leaves  
but make no mistake  
the quicksand planet does care
