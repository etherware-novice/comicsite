	<h2>2024-08-14</h2>
	<p>i think almost all of my problems are from just<br>
	not being able to let go and make something without<br>
	worrying about it being "good" or not..<br>
	my webcomic is terrible from an objective standpoint<br>
	i keep just doing stupid jokes and theres no development<br>
	ever and i keep forgetting stuff that made it more unique<br>
	bc i keep falling into the same formula of "make one off joke"<br>
	and all my drawings are the same i cant innovate anything<br>
	everything ive made was just a random thought that i threw<br>
	out and most of those get shut down because im "scared" of<br>
	it the only reason i even started the comic in the first<br>
	place was i pressured myself to from the USENET group and<br>
	kept going and now im stuck in a stupid loop again of making<br>
	the same stuff over and over and god i wish i could just like<br>
	commit to a storyline that was more than 2 pages long or more<br>
	unique character designs that arent just stolen from games im<br>
	obsessed with or "inspired" recolors of another persons char<br>
	and like i cant see the stupidest stuff like "a bug society"<br>
	without losing my fking mind and i am definitely a bug/slime<br>
	furry at this point and i hate it and i wish i was normal about<br>
	these things why cant i just SEE SOMEONE ELSES WEBCOMIC ABOUT BUGS<br>
	without like losing my mind or a game cough bug fables i hate it<br>
	frickin aaaaghhh</p>
