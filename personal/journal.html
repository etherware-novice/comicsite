	<p>Wow, a whole month before I tore down the<br>
	journal page again!! cool, huh??<br>
	now i get what people mean with "teenage mood swings"<br>
	i left the last article so i have something<br>
	to reference to copy this properly<br>
	these journals keep getting either<br>
	too negative or fall into disuse because<br>
	my life is incredibly boring besides like<br>
	talking about what i did online which would<br>
	make me sound like a really sad person and stuff<br>
	also my hyperfixations got me into trouble again<br>
	i really wish i could either be normal and not<br>
	obsess over real disorders people actually deal with<br>
	(DiD/pluralness) or just actually have it so i can feel<br>
	justified in being so interested and like be able to<br>
	interact with the community better and stuff and also in general<br>
	not have social anxiety and ok its getting too negative again<br>
	would it be wrong to say i want to inflict myself with it</p>
