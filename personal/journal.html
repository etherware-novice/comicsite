	<h2>2024-11-16</h2>
	<p>the fear of being a newbie<br>
	basically if theres one thing i hate more than anything<br>
	its not being able to feel proud of my work<br>
	and thats the whole thing about sucking at something/<br>
	doing it scared that i hate its that like i cant<br>
	feel proud of it, or i feel like just like a little kid<br>
	playing with their stupid legos while like the actually experienced<br>
	guys go and have fun and the progress is so slow i feel like<br>
	im doing it wrong but no i just have to keep making dumb stupid<br>
	stuff and it feels terrible and<br>
	especially with all the people who've been doing this stuff for<br>
	like years like i know that normal (not insane) people look at<br>
	that and are all "oh man theyve been doing it for so long<br>
	of course theyre better and there was a time that they sucked<br>
	too" and get motivated and stuff i wish i could be like that<br>
	for me its more "oh man theyve been doing this 10 years<br>
	that- i dont even know if i'll still be doing this in 10<br>
	years and what if i never get that good and oh god how will i<br>
	ever be able to compete with that even if i do keep at it for<br>
	10 years then theyll have done it for 20!!!! and like i just<br>
	wish i could like be ,more, like i didnt worry about it like<br>
	a normal person like i could just go make stuff and not worry<br>
	about how bad it is and feel panicked and beg people for help<br>
	and make them hate me over and over and over and i could just<br>
	write, or like draw, or whatever<br>
	the only field that this doesnt apply to is like coding bc<br>
	i have beein doing it for 10 years and stuff but like<br>
	<br>
	i wish i could take as much pride in my own stuff as i do in theirs<br>
	but like not in a stealing way</p>

	<h2>2024-11-13</h2>
	<p>creativity, spontaneousness, and sandboxes (why i suck at all of it)<br>
	i always have an issue with sandboxes, and that's this<br>
	I NEED SOME KIND OF DIRECTION.<br>
	like, the "fear of the blank canvas" also applies to sandbox<br>
	games and a little bit webdevelopment?<br>
	like i cant just DO something i have to have an idea first and<br>
	some kinda plan and its also really hard i feel like to make<br>
	something i actually connect with in these and seeing how<br>
	effortlessly other people can just do stuff is frustrating<br>
	and makes me want to play them even less and it just repeats<br>
	same with something like the everyone site on melonland, i feel<br>
	like i have to make something of value but cant<br>
	i know its the self confidence piece it always is i just cant<br>
	do a leap of faith and try to make something silly im sorry</p>

	<h2>2024-11-12</h2>
	<p>Did you know that often, "deleting" something<br>
	on a computer doesn't actually delete it? All it does<br>
	is remove the entry on the disk telling the computer<br>
	"hey, there's data here", and that its free to overwrite<br>
	from a technical standpoint its more efficient, obviously<br>
	why waste time zeroing out a section when it'll be overwritten<br>
	with data anyways?<br>
	i feel like theres some symbolic meaning there, though...<br>
	like, data (experience) is meaningless without direction..<br>
	or like how neglecting a part of you will cause it to become<br>
	more repressed and stuff...like me...<br>
	theres something there, ok?

	<h2>2024-11-11</h2>
	<p>Wow, a palindrome day! I was intensly confused<br>
	this morning because I woke up at like 5am and thought my<br>
	watches date display turned into a table<br>
	(the font makes 1's look like lowecase l's)<br>
	anyways so after the youtube free thing ive been starting<br>
	to listen to music more, more specifically the stuff from<br>
	Hypnospace Outlaw, which I am currently hyperfixated on its<br>
	such a good awesome game and I adore ittttt</p>

	<h2>2024-11-10</h2>
	<p>art as the reflection of yourself<br>
	yes i know thats a generic title but idk<br>
	i really want to express myself here<br>
	thoughts are hard to make clear<br>
	i feel like this site really isnt me<br>
	idk how to express it more</p>
</article>

<article>
	<h2>2024-11-10</h2>
	<p>inconvenience is inconvenience, and i don't understand why<br>
	people aim for it. on one hand, yes the art implications stuff<br>
	not being able to see everything is frustrating though<br>
	i want people to like my site<br>
	whats the point of putting time into something but<br>
	actively roadblocking people from seeing it??<br>
	i dont know, maybe its just my weird obsession<br>
	with having my stuff liked, but i dont get it<br>
	<br>
	and yes i do think melons forum should be open on mondays</p>

	<h2>2024-11-09</h2>
	<p>I'm finally commiting to things!<br>
	I managed to force myself to do the "No youtube november"<br>
	challenge from the melonforums, and it has made me feel<br>
	more willing to work on the website some</p>

	<h2>2024-11-07</h2>
	<p>i feel like every single problem i've ever<br>
	had in the creative space can be boiled down<br>
	into this image:<br>
	<img src="/personal/gomap.png"></img><br>
	like, if i could just shut the frick up and<br>
	"do it scared" i could get something done but<br>
	i just have to try and force someone "successful"<br>
	to help when i feel like im failing and<br>
	it doesnt fix the problem of being scared to fail and<br>
	ill eventually annoy them to the point they hate me again<br>
	<br>
	for creative stuff especially i feel like im falling<br>
	into the trap of making the same kind of character, or<br>
	like being unable to write a different perspective (or at all)<br>
	i KNOW if I JUST SAT DOWN and WROTE i could EVENTULLY make someting PASSABLE but my STUPID BRAIN just gets PARALYZED at the SLIGHTEST HINT OF RESISTANCE and i just run to SOMEONE ELSE to GET ME TO DO IT I<br>
	<br>
	im sorry for all the negativity here but im trying to<br>
	be more vulnerable here and this is how i am</p>
</article>

<article>
	<h2>2024-11-07</h2>
	<p>its really cool seeing such a wide range of<br>
	states that people visit from, even if i never<br>
	get to talk to them just seeing that is cool</p>
</article>

<article>
	<h2>2024-11-04</h2>
	<p>back here again, i guess<br>
	being scared of things seems to be my entire driving force huh<br>
	i wish it wasnt but its the only thing that reliably motivates<br>
	me to do anything but lay around and be pathetic and waste time<br>
	scared that if i stopped doing art id never start again<br>
	or people would forget me<br>
	id just be another face, nice to talk to but gone instantly<br>
	i already tried this stupid journal thing three times and<br>
	deleted everything or gave up because it was just me whining<br>
	and being a stupid little edgy teen because my life is literally<br>
	just uni and discord/stupid frking forums and who wants to read<br>
	about that "oh i went to school it was uneventful then i went<br>
	online and talked with people about nothing like the last 500<br>
	entries" i dont know what to do<br>
	sorry for another negative entry but again barely anything<br>
	happens here</p>
</article>

<article>
	<h2>2024-09-30</h2>
	<p>Wow, a whole month before I tore down the<br>
	journal page again!! cool, huh??<br>
	now i get what people mean with "teenage mood swings"<br>
	i left the last article so i have something<br>
	to reference to copy this properly<br>
	these journals keep getting either<br>
	too negative or fall into disuse because<br>
	my life is incredibly boring besides like<br>
	talking about what i did online which would<br>
	make me sound like a really sad person and stuff<br>
	also my hyperfixations got me into trouble again<br>
	i really wish i could either be normal and not<br>
	obsess over real disorders people actually deal with<br>
	(DiD/pluralness) or just actually have it so i can feel<br>
	justified in being so interested and like be able to<br>
	interact with the community better and stuff and also in general<br>
	not have social anxiety and ok its getting too negative again<br>
	would it be wrong to say i want to inflict myself with it</p>
</article>

	<h2>2024-09-26</h2>
