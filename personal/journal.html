	(14:04)<br>
	well i got a headphones and a stress toy thingy<br>
	we still have 7 more nights to go tho so im excited<br>
	also the "9th day gift" of sending the appeal which<br>
	ill finally be free of this guilt ive felt over the last month<br>
	i really really really hope they accept it<br>
	and now my parents are going out again which again kinda sucs,,<br>
	(15:56)<br>
	i spent the last hour debugging those headphones<br>
	turns out the cable wasnt plugged in fully<br>
	yipeeeeeeeee<br>
	(16:29)<br>
	god i hope im not past being able to be forgiven by them<br>
	(17:40)<br>
	wel;l bench made a server 2 weeks ago<br>
	they said no for NOW but t thats also like maybe a way to maybe<br>
	show people that ive changed and stuff and that im worthy of<br>
	maybe getting another chance im SORRY im SORRY IM SORRY<br>
	(18:02)<br>
	i really hope i can get like in a friendgroup in this community<br>
	or something idk i wish i had like more interaction and like<br>
	a group to bounce stories off in our blogs or something but<br>
	it feels so impossible and asking the people who do have it<br>
	just leads to hurting them i just want to be like i just want<br>
	to matter to like a group or something and be part of a group<br>
	and stuff i dont knowwwwww<br>
	am i doing this right?? am i just never going to get there?<br>
	forcing it doesnt work but waiting feels like just giving up<br>
[snip]<br>
	but if i really want this i have to be patient and NOT force it<br>
	just stay calm and actually really respect people and ill<br>
	maybe get the chance to do collab stuff maybe after enough time<br>
	i hope<br>
	(18:44)<br>
	i really hope they are still willing to accept me i really do<br>

	idk tho i still feel like im kinda in the wrong for like<br>
	trying to force interaction again<br>

	(23:52)<br>
	yk what i feel kinda proud of what ive done in this space<br>
	sure its not as great as what theyre doing and stuff but<br>
	i probably needed that time away from them to stop focusing<br>
	on what they were doing so heavily and just freaking do my<br>
	own thing!! and i really hope they do end up forgiving me<br>
	in the end. i really really do. ive been worrying about it<br>
	for almost a month now.<br>

	(13:46)<br>
	HOLLYYYY SHIT NEW TF2 COMIC DROP IT WAS AMAZING<br>
	(17:50)<br>
	maybe im too negative sometimes<br>
	sorry to anyone whos still reading after the disaster of this month<br>
	and the last<br>
	(18:00)<br>
	you know what<br>
	its ok im not making much progress on the site<br>
	its ok im not doing much on the blog right now<br>
	it takes time
	</p>

<article>
	<h2>2024-12-19</h2>
	<p>(18:15)<br>
	been in a bit of a social slump lately<br>
	barely checked discord/tumbr or the melonland forum<br>
	at least moosky and turtle are nice to talk to<br>
	and i really hope the server guys will want to talk again<br>
	also i set up my raspberry pis again and they are cool servers :D<br>
	(18:22)<br>
	oh yea i guess i didnt mention it before<br>
	parents are back but they have to go out again on christmas/channukah<br>
	tho this time theyll be back before channukahs over..<br>
	ig they have a lot of stuff to bring from my grandmas house<br>
	(19:21)<br>
	man screw this im not in the right headspace to make another comic<br>
	i dont even care if i skipped twice im drowning<br>
	(20:36)<br>
	god d a m n it why do i care so much about a stupid tubr event<br>
	im thrwoing shit at the wall and i feel terrible about it<br>
	(21:31)<br>
	okok ive calmed down a bit<br>
	im not terrible im not terrible im not terrible<br>
	as long as im not inflicting other people with it<br>
	its fine im fine<br>
	thats why i keep this blog i guess now just to dump all<br>
	my terrible thoughts instead f inflicting it on other people<br>
	(21:34)<br>
	ok so the whole problem stems from wanting to be involved<br>
	with the collaborative stuff my friends are doing<br>
	(yes bench is my friend again they forgave me and refriended)<br>
	and also feeling like im unable to do that because of all the<br>
	failures in the past so i try to reach out for help to do that<br>
	in a frantic stupid terrible ourobouros that just hurts people<br>
	but so as long as i just ignore that feeling long enough i can<br>
	maybe do something cool with them<br>
	its almost paradoxical, huh.. to do the stuff i want to i have<br>
	to give up on doing the things now and stop letting it weigh on<br>
	my mind.. yk what at least i handled it better this time i didnt<br>
	try to reach out im STILL WAITING FOR JANUARY because i really<br>
	want to show that ive changed and this time yk this time i just<br>
	calmed down offline mostly and screamed into the void (blog)<br>
	so hopefully this doesnt mean that im making no progress hopefully<br>
	i DONT WANT TO HURT THEM AGAIN NOT AGAIN THATS NOT WHAT A FRIEND DOES
	frik im going to go play some balatro to get my mind off this<br>
	(22:05)<br>
	well i won the balatro game<br>
	feeling a bit better<br>
	tho again i really hope the server accepts me again<br>
	(22:14)<br>
	maybe i cant always have a ton of interaction every day<br>
	"sometimes you need the bad moments to make the good ones better"
	(23:00)<br>
	ok im deleting a bunch from the 20:36 entry and going to bed

	"gave" me my gifts (they left it in the office)<br>

	<h2>2024-12-13</h2>
	<p>(12:06)<br>
	wow, two full days without drawing or being negative on here?<br>
	what am i becoming /j<br>
	oh i forgot to talk about it earlier but<br>
	i joined another webring, a goofy one my friend is running<br>
	called the "silly ring" (you can see the badge on the homepage)<br>
	obviously once i reorganize the site i'll put it somewhere else..<br>
	then again most of the other ones are hardcoded to /comic..<br>
	well thats a problem for future me :)<br>
	(14:21)<br>
	just found out my balatro save was wiped :(<br>
	(14:53)<br>
	this is a pretty weird year for my bday because<br>
	in almost every other year its overlapped with channukah<br>
	also parents not being there and not my sister either<br>
	soo yeah hope it goes well<br>
	(15:01)<br>
	ok yk what im going to put the site redesign on hold "officially"<br>
	until i get these drawings done<br>
	(16:50)<br>
	got my secret santa drawing done after 3 weeks of procastination<br>
	(20:35)<br>
	i kinda hope the redux server thinks to maybe reach out for my<br>
	birthday it would be nice but im not getting my hopes up..<br>
	(21:46)<br>
	well due to massive indecision between me and my brother<br>
	we are just now ordering wings yes at almost 10 at night<br>
	at least i get my lemon pepper wings :D
	(22:59)<br>
	stuffed right before i havto go to bed<br>
	its gonna be hard to sleep again<br>
	(23:05)<br>
	screw it im just gonna play my 3ds until it hits midnight<br>
	like last years birthday<br>
	(00:01)<br>

	<h2>2024-12-11</h2>
	<p>(12:49)<br>
	starting to feel more comfortable in pkrl somewhat<br>
	trying to let go of my fear more<br>
	the community is nice..<br>
	(16:59)<br>
	well the city emailed back about the volunteer thing<br>
	no idea if i got it but fingers crossed<br>
	(22:08)<br>
	wow ok wow :D<br>
	my sister came over and gave me and my brother a bday bunt cake!!<br>
	and we got to have a full family meal for the first time in a<br>

	<h2>2024-12-10</h2>
	<p>(12:11)<br>
	got back from therapists and instantly passed out :P<br>
	if that doesnt show my sleep schedule is broked..<br>
	(14:49)<br>
	trying not to worryyyyy<br>
	(17:55)<br>
	it is so cold out rn<br>
	my hands are shaking pretty bad<br>
	(18:54)<br>
	maybe my issue is trying to force myself into stuff i want<br>
	and being jealous of people who do have that<br>
	and wanting to get that quickly as a twisted way to<br>
	stop the feeling of being left out quickly<br>
	and that i should just try to take things slow<br>
	maybe being forced out of that server was a sign to<br>
	build patience and stuff and that i need to wait a<br>
	substantial amount of time before trying<br>
	it will hurt but this time i will change<br>
	and wont hurt them again<br>
	i wont<br>
	(19:29)<br>
	went to volunteer for some random photography thing<br>
	in my city cuz parents forcing me to do something this break<br>
	(20:00)<br>
	oh yea i guess i didnt mention it here yet<br>
	my parents arent going to be around for my birthday..<br>
	i understand why but it still does suck a bit<br>
	im hoping i can get a college friend to do something w/ me

	<h2>2024-12-09</h2>
	<p>(12:47)<br>
	i want to change the layout of my site but cant find<br>
	a layout idea i like.. but im going to keep working at it<br>
	(16:51)<br>
	finished my drawing for them.. ended up just doing a l4d2 "poster"<br>
	ill dump it into the gallery too if you want to see it<br>
	we're going out to some fancy restaurant too in like 10 minutes<br>
	printing out the drawing and throwing this update in real quick<br>
	(19:45)<br>
	dinner itself was good<br>
	brother kept trying to embarrass me again like yesterday<br>
	IN FRONT OF PARENTS which SUCKED and I WISH HE WOULD STOP<br>
	also my sister wasnt there nobody ended up inviting them<br>
	bc of how last minute the dinner was apparently<br>
	he left for the store before i could give him his drawing<br>
	(20:14)<br>
	he liked the drawing!!<br>
	(22:53)<br>
	finally starting to calm down from the server disaster<br>
	im a bit more confident i can really truly change<br>
	and i hope i can get another chance maybe<br>
	also ill try to work on the website more tomorrow..

	<h2>2024-12-08</h2>
	<p>(18:14)<br>
	holy piss i just noticed the "12 people on 12/6" stat<br>
	who is this interested in my site??<br>
	also im honestly surprised i forgot i put up a working rss<br>
	feed, i assumed it was broken like the comic rss feed<br>
	to be fair that feed is useful to notify when i change stuff<br>
	bc (at least on my side) it re-notifies me every time i push<br>
	changes so who knows and hello to the rss readers??<br>
	if there are any?? also if its the server, again hi and im sorry<br>
	well uh the day was wasted trying to reflash my 3ds<br>
	something broke really hardd<br>
	im well on my way to getting back to pokemon black tho<br>
	(00:12)<br>
	yes its technically tomorrow but im seperating these based<br>
	on when i sleep instead of actual days and stuff :)<br>
	anyways yes its the 9th now which means its my brothers bday<br>
	and yes i know his is 5 days before mine..<br>
	i dont know what to draw him bc most of the games he likes are<br>
	like the modern shooters with gruff army guys and thats like<br>
	the opposite of what i draw<br>
	i tried asking him and just got teased about buge fabls again<br>
	which was COOL and DIDNT make me want to HIT HIM<br>
	<br>
	also again with the weird goatcounter numbers<br>
	WHY DID 4 PEOPLE RANDOMLY DECIDE TO READ NOV 10'TH COMIC<br>
	IN THE LAST *HOUR*?? It's even WEIRDER because ALL OF THE<br>
	VIEWS SAY THEYRE REFFERED FROM MELONKING WHICH IS CLOSED RN<br>
	NOT EVEN THE FORUM WHICH MIGHT MAKE A BIT OF SENSE<br>
	the ONLY thing i can think of is someone went to the<br>
	flood ring info page, went to my site for some reason, and<br>
	showed a random comic page to their friends which like<br>
	WHO WOULD DO THAT???<br>
	also holy hell who is the one person finding my hidden writings<br>
	and again why/how is the refferer melonking.net?? there is NO<br>
	possible way for someone to find them there is no link anywhere<br>
	its also kinda funny how im starting to maybe attract ppl from the<br>
	pkrl space with the neoskitties stuff since that page is getting<br>
	more viewers... maybe i should put actual effort into it.<br>
	maybe at some point who knows??? maybe once the server stuff is fixed which again im sorry abt<br>
	also again with this page suddenly becoming the most visited<br>
	aside from the index is slightly weird and makes me wonder<br>
	whos actually reading this and/or if its just rss feeds<br>
	inflating the number but who knows???<br>
	oh yea wait before i leave i should probably give a slight<br>
	update on how im going to be doing the journal<br>
	im gonna be writing it throughout the day like i did here<br>
	and push it the next day<br>
	so each days entries will be up the next day<br>
	anyway gn ill push this tomrw along with an update to the<br>
	gallery page..

	<h2>2024-12-07</h2>
	<p>im still feeling guilty but im trying to move<br>
	past it and im trying to legitimately improve<br>
	ill maybe try to appeal in a month or so or when<br>
	i actually become a better person.. i hope they give<br>
	me another chance but i get if they dont<br>
	ive been trying to keep up on my blogs<br>
	i couldnt post much today because of the aforementioned<br>
	SATURDAY TEST but ill post more tomorrow.<br>
	at least my semester is officially ovvverr!!<br>
	<br>
	im kinda worried about my relationship w/ bench bc like<br>
	after they refriended me after the apology the conversations<br>
	have been like really stilted and im running out of things to<br>
	talk about and stuff it feels like theyre just tolerating me<br>
	talking to them idk i hope i can figure out how to talk to people<br>
	like a normal person and stuff<br>
	<br>
	also the sudden spike in people checking this page is<br>
	a bit worrying, like a fourth of the visits on my site<br>
	have been on this page... redux server is that you??</p>
</article>

<article>
	<h2>2024-12-05</h2>
	<p>i think/hope that bench doesnt find me annoying<br>
	uh so its almost the end of the semester which is nice<br>
	and im going to have to find some excuse of a thing to do<br>
	so my parents dont complain about me "doing nothing" for<br>
	a month which isnt nice<br>
	struggling to keep up with my personal projects<br>
	(the comic and working on new stuff for this site)<br>
	so idk id do pretty bad at a job<br>
	that last final is still looming though</p>
</article>

<article>
	<h2>2024-12-04</h2>
	<p>well things are finally going the other way with that group<br>
	they uh found the apology<br>
	hopefully i never hurt them again<br>
	<br>
	anyways ig ill talk about my real life bc i swear<br>
	i have one outside of being online<br>
	finals week! i have one test down, getting a 51/50 on my<br>
	compsci test.. and one to go, which is on a saturday, WHY?!</p>

	or like how do u fix relationship with someone<br>
	please i dont want to be hated please please<br>
	im sorry how do i fix this please</p>
</article>

<article>
	<h2>2024-11-30</h2>
	<p>I feel like I should write something less intense after that<br>
	so I guess I'll double dip and talk about the trip..<br>
	Honestly, it was pretty short. We didn't get to do too much..<br>
	It was planned out so that we avoided the massive rush of<br>
	Monday and Sunday, instead choosing the day before and after<br>
	Thanksgiving to take advantage of the lower yield. Pretty clever,<br>
	but again it didn't leave much time to hang out with family.<br>
	I did get to play tennis though, which was fun until my<br>
	cousin chased and hit me with a racket repeatedly.<br>
	Also, we watched some movies. My mom hates <i>The princess Bride</i><br>
	for some reason, but my uncles were clever and put it on<br>
	before we came to the house so I got to watch some :)<br>
	The cooking was fantastic, a lot of my family are really good<br>
	chefs, and I'm sad we couldn't take most of it on the plane.<br>
	Also, we tried to do some black friday shopping but ended up<br>
	not really buying a lot. Overall, pretty alright trip.</p>

	<summary>2024-11-30/apology</summary>
	<p>Today's only the 30th by technicality, it<br>
	just hit midnight 5 minutes ago. Still, I'm leaving it<br>
	because it looks nicer.<br>
	<br>
	So.<br>
	I fucked up bad with that group.<br>
	I'm writing my apology here in the extremely rare chance that<br>
	one of them happens to check my site.<br>
	Also, I've had some time to think about it, both literally<br>
	being banned indefinitely and having very little computer<br>
	access until just now because of thanksgiving travel.<br>
	Maybe writing out an actual apology will help some,<br>
	even if they never end up seeing it.<br>
	godamnit im stalling<br>
	<br>
	Bench, I'm sorry for continuing to beg for help and<br>
	not understanding the boundaries you set. I was getting<br>
	too emotional and scared about the new stuff, but I shouldn't<br>
	have expected you to hold my hand through it. I'll continue<br>
	to try writing and maybe it'll go somewhere. I just need to<br>
	give it time and stop letting my anxiety about it force me<br>
	to push boundaries too hard. I'm sorry for mistreating you,<br>
	and if you ever do end up letting me back I promise I will<br>
	be a better person and actively push myself to not repeat it<br>
	again. I'm sorry.<br>
	<br>
	Allistor, I'm sorry for the message spam after what happened<br>
	Again, I was too emotional, but I should've just stepped back<br>
	and not done it.<br>
	<br>
	To everyone else, I promise I will try to change and be a less<br>
	annoying person who pushes too hard sometimes.</p>

	<p>man i hate my parents sometimes<br>
	"oh just get a friend in every class you<br>
	should have at least one friend in every class"<br>
	like i can just snap my fingers and get someone to<br>
	like me?? like god im amazed i even got one friend<br>
	and that was basically by accident and we still barely<br>
	talk outside class and im worried its going to fall through<br>
	again and if you havent noticed im terrible with all relationships<br>
	the stupid putting myself down is probably just like a<br>
	idk a defense mechanism because im scared of making<br>
	something "bad" because i look up to so many people and<br>
	so many other guys have such incredible stuff<br>
	(art, websites, writing, pkrl) and it feels terrible to me<br>
	because theres no way that i could do that without building<br>
	up to it and that practice feels so indirect and like im making<br>
	no progress and just desperately trying to chase someone else<br>
	and not being able to get there before losing steam and feeling<br>
	ashamed because i failed at it and idk IDK i really want to do<br>
	cool stuff too and be in a group without worrying if they like me</p>

	feel proud of it, or i feel like just like a little kid<br>
	playing with their stupid legos while like the actually experienced<br>
	guys go and have fun and the progress is so slow i feel like<br>
	im doing it wrong but no i just have to keep making dumb stupid<br>
	stuff and it feels terrible and<br>
	especially with all the people who've been doing this stuff for<br>
	like years like i know that normal (not insane) people look at<br>
	that and are all "oh man theyve been doing it for so long<br>
	of course theyre better and there was a time that they sucked<br>
	too" and get motivated and stuff i wish i could be like that<br>
	for me its more "oh man theyve been doing this 10 years<br>
	that- i dont even know if i'll still be doing this in 10<br>
	years and what if i never get that good and oh god how will i<br>
	ever be able to compete with that even if i do keep at it for<br>
	10 years then theyll have done it for 20!!!! and like i just<br>
	wish i could like be ,more, like i didnt worry about it like<br>
	a normal person like i could just go make stuff and not worry<br>
	about how bad it is and feel panicked and beg people for help<br>
	and make them hate me over and over and over and i could just<br>
	write, or like draw, or whatever<br>
	the only field that this doesnt apply to is like coding bc<br>
	i have beein doing it for 10 years and stuff but like<br>
	<br>
	i wish i could take as much pride in my own stuff as i do in theirs<br>
	but like not in a stealing way</p>

	<p>creativity, spontaneousness, and sandboxes (why i suck at all of it)<br>
	i always have an issue with sandboxes, and that's this<br>
	I NEED SOME KIND OF DIRECTION.<br>
	like, the "fear of the blank canvas" also applies to sandbox<br>
	games and a little bit webdevelopment?<br>
	like i cant just DO something i have to have an idea first and<br>
	some kinda plan and its also really hard i feel like to make<br>
	something i actually connect with in these and seeing how<br>
	effortlessly other people can just do stuff is frustrating<br>
	and makes me want to play them even less and it just repeats<br>
	same with something like the everyone site on melonland, i feel<br>
	like i have to make something of value but cant<br>
	i know its the self confidence piece it always is i just cant<br>
	do a leap of faith and try to make something silly im sorry</p>

	<p>Did you know that often, "deleting" something<br>
	on a computer doesn't actually delete it? All it does<br>
	is remove the entry on the disk telling the computer<br>
	"hey, there's data here", and that its free to overwrite<br>
	from a technical standpoint its more efficient, obviously<br>
	why waste time zeroing out a section when it'll be overwritten<br>
	with data anyways?<br>
	i feel like theres some symbolic meaning there, though...<br>
	like, data (experience) is meaningless without direction..<br>
	or like how neglecting a part of you will cause it to become<br>
	more repressed and stuff...like me...<br>
	theres something there, ok?

	<p>Wow, a palindrome day! I was intensly confused<br>
	this morning because I woke up at like 5am and thought my<br>
	watches date display turned into a table<br>
	(the font makes 1's look like lowecase l's)<br>
	anyways so after the youtube free thing ive been starting<br>
	to listen to music more, more specifically the stuff from<br>
	Hypnospace Outlaw, which I am currently hyperfixated on its<br>
	such a good awesome game and I adore ittttt</p>

	<p>art as the reflection of yourself<br>
	yes i know thats a generic title but idk<br>
	i really want to express myself here<br>
	thoughts are hard to make clear<br>
	i feel like this site really isnt me<br>
	idk how to express it more</p>

	<p>inconvenience is inconvenience, and i don't understand why<br>
	people aim for it. on one hand, yes the art implications stuff<br>
	not being able to see everything is frustrating though<br>
	i want people to like my site<br>
	whats the point of putting time into something but<br>
	actively roadblocking people from seeing it??<br>
	i dont know, maybe its just my weird obsession<br>
	with having my stuff liked, but i dont get it<br>
	<br>
	and yes i do think melons forum should be open on mondays</p>

	<p>i feel like every single problem i've ever<br>
	had in the creative space can be boiled down<br>
	into this image:<br>
	<img src="/personal/gomap.png"></img><br>
	like, if i could just shut the frick up and<br>
	"do it scared" i could get something done but<br>
	i just have to try and force someone "successful"<br>
	to help when i feel like im failing and<br>
	it doesnt fix the problem of being scared to fail and<br>
	ill eventually annoy them to the point they hate me again<br>
	<br>
	for creative stuff especially i feel like im falling<br>
	into the trap of making the same kind of character, or<br>
	like being unable to write a different perspective (or at all)<br>
	i KNOW if I JUST SAT DOWN and WROTE i could EVENTULLY make someting PASSABLE but my STUPID BRAIN just gets PARALYZED at the SLIGHTEST HINT OF RESISTANCE and i just run to SOMEONE ELSE to GET ME TO DO IT I<br>
	<br>
	im sorry for all the negativity here but im trying to<br>
	be more vulnerable here and this is how i am</p>

	<p>its really cool seeing such a wide range of<br>

	get to talk to them just seeing that is cool</p>

	<h2>2024-11-04</h2>
	<p>back here again, i guess<br>
	being scared of things seems to be my entire driving force huh<br>
	i wish it wasnt but its the only thing that reliably motivates<br>
	me to do anything but lay around and be pathetic and waste time<br>
	scared that if i stopped doing art id never start again<br>
	or people would forget me<br>
	id just be another face, nice to talk to but gone instantly<br>
	i already tried this stupid journal thing three times and<br>
	deleted everything or gave up because it was just me whining<br>
	and being a stupid little edgy teen because my life is literally<br>
	just uni and discord/stupid frking forums and who wants to read<br>
	about that "oh i went to school it was uneventful then i went<br>
	online and talked with people about nothing like the last 500<br>
	entries" i dont know what to do<br>
	sorry for another negative entry but again barely anything<br>
	happens here</p>
</article>

	<h2>2024-09-30</h2>
	<p>Wow, a whole month before I tore down the<br>
	journal page again!! cool, huh??<br>
	now i get what people mean with "teenage mood swings"<br>
	i left the last article so i have something<br>
	to reference to copy this properly<br>
	these journals keep getting either<br>
	too negative or fall into disuse because<br>
	my life is incredibly boring besides like<br>
	talking about what i did online which would<br>
	make me sound like a really sad person and stuff<br>
	also my hyperfixations got me into trouble again<br>
	i really wish i could either be normal and not<br>
	obsess over real disorders people actually deal with<br>
	(DiD/pluralness) or just actually have it so i can feel<br>
	justified in being so interested and like be able to<br>
	interact with the community better and stuff and also in general<br>
	not have social anxiety and ok its getting too negative again<br>
	would it be wrong to say i want to inflict myself with it</p>
